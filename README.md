Explaination of the LU decomposition code:

Below is a detailed walkthrough of the LU decomposition module code—with an emphasis on understanding its finite state machine (FSM) design. We’ll explain the purpose of each block and how the FSM transitions from one state to the next.
1. Module Overview

The module implements LU decomposition for a 4×4 matrix. It takes as input a 512-bit bus A_in that contains 16 (4×4) 32-bit words in a flattened (row-major) format. Two 512-bit outputs, L_out and U_out, are used to return the lower (L) and upper (U) triangular matrices, respectively.

The algorithm implemented is (without pivoting):

For k=0k=0 to 3:

    Compute the U row:
    U[k][j]=A[k][j]−∑m=0k−1L[k][m]×U[m][j]for j=k…3
    U[k][j]=A[k][j]−m=0∑k−1​L[k][m]×U[m][j]for j=k…3
    Compute the L column:
    L[i][k]=A[i][k]−∑m=0k−1L[i][m]×U[m][k]U[k][k]for i=k+1…3
    L[i][k]=U[k][k]A[i][k]−∑m=0k−1​L[i][m]×U[m][k]​for i=k+1…3
    The diagonal of L is forced to 1.

Because we are using a finite state machine, the entire calculation is broken down into small steps and controlled via state transitions.
2. Internal Data Structures

    Arrays:
    The matrices are stored in flattened arrays:
        A[0:15]: Holds the input matrix.
        L[0:15]: Will hold the lower triangular matrix.
        U[0:15]: Will hold the upper triangular matrix.

    The element at row r and column c is stored at index (r*4 + c).

    Counters and Registers:
        k: The current pivot (or diagonal) index (0 to 3).
        i: Used when processing rows (for computing L values).
        j: Used when processing columns (for computing U values).
        m: Used for the summation in both the U and L computations.
        sum: Accumulates the summation results in the inner loops.

    FSM State Variable:
        state: A 4-bit register that holds the current FSM state.

3. FSM States Overview

The FSM is defined using a set of states. Here is a summary of each:

    IDLE:
        Purpose: Wait for the start signal.
        Action: The module sits idle until start is asserted.
    LOAD:
        Purpose: Load the input matrix from the 512-bit bus A_in into the internal array A.
        Action: A for loop assigns each 32-bit slice of A_in to the array A.
    INIT:
        Purpose: Initialize the L and U arrays.
        Action:
            Set every element in L and U to 0.
            Set the diagonal of L to 1 (i.e., L[0][0], L[1][1], etc.).
            Initialize the pivot counter k to 0.
        Transition: Proceeds to computing the first row of U.
    U_START:
        Purpose: Begin computing the U matrix elements for the current pivot row k.
        Action:
            Set j = k (the starting column for U for the current row).
            Clear the summation register sum.
            Set m = 0 to start the inner summation loop.
        Transition: Move to the inner loop state U_M_LOOP.
    U_M_LOOP:
        Purpose: Accumulate the sum for computing U[k][j]U[k][j].
        Action:
            For each m from 0 to k−1k−1, add L[k][m]×U[m][j]L[k][m]×U[m][j] to sum.
            When m reaches k, the summation is complete.
        Transition: Go to U_STORE to calculate and store U[k][j]U[k][j].
    U_STORE:
        Purpose: Compute and store the value U[k][j]=A[k][j]−sumU[k][j]=A[k][j]−sum.
        Action:
            Store the computed value into the U array.
            If there are more columns in the current row (j < 3), increment j and restart the inner summation by setting m = 0 and clearing sum.
            If the current row is finished (i.e., j has reached 3), then if there is more work to do (i.e., if k < 3), the FSM transitions to compute the L values for column k.
    L_START:
        Purpose: Begin computing the L matrix elements for the current pivot column k (for rows below the pivot row).
        Action:
            Set the row index i = k+1.
            Clear the summation register sum and reset m to 0.
        Transition: Move to the inner loop state L_M_LOOP.
    L_M_LOOP:
        Purpose: Accumulate the sum for computing L[i][k]L[i][k].
        Action:
            For each m from 0 to k−1k−1, add L[i][m]×U[m][k]L[i][m]×U[m][k] to sum.
            When m reaches k, the summation is complete.
        Transition: Proceed to L_STORE to finalize the L element.
    L_STORE:
        Purpose: Compute and store the value:
        L[i][k]=A[i][k]−sumU[k][k]
        L[i][k]=U[k][k]A[i][k]−sum​
        Action:
            Store the computed value in the L array.
            If there are more rows to compute for the current pivot column (i < 3), increment i and restart the inner summation (m and sum are reset).
            Otherwise, move on to the next pivot by transitioning to the NEXT_K state.
    NEXT_K:
        Purpose: Prepare for the next pivot column.
        Action:
            Increment k.
            If k is less than 3, start processing the next row of U (go back to U_START).
            If k reaches 3, all decompositions have been computed, so move to the final state.
    DONE_STATE:
        Purpose: Pack the computed L and U arrays into the 512-bit output buses and assert the done signal.
        Action:
            Use a for loop to assign each 32-bit word from L and U into L_out and U_out.
            Assert the done signal to indicate that the computation is complete.

4. Step-by-Step Walkthrough

Let’s trace the FSM as it processes a matrix (suppose the test matrix is as given in the testbench):
Starting Up

    IDLE State:
    The module waits for the start signal. When start goes high, the FSM moves to LOAD.

    LOAD State:
    The 512-bit input bus A_in is sliced into 16 separate 32-bit numbers and stored in the array A.

    INIT State:
    The L and U arrays are cleared. The L matrix is initialized so that its diagonal elements are set to 1. The pivot index k is set to 0.

Processing the First Pivot (k = 0)

    U_START State:
        Set j = 0 (since for U, we start at column k).
        Clear sum and set m = 0.

    U_M_LOOP State:
        Since m < k (here k=0k=0), this loop does not execute any iterations. The FSM quickly transitions to U_STORE.

    U_STORE State:
        Compute U[0][0]=A[0][0]−sumU[0][0]=A[0][0]−sum (with sum being 0), so U[0][0]=A[0][0]U[0][0]=A[0][0].
        Then, check if there are more columns in row 0 (i.e., if j < 3). If yes, increment j and repeat the U calculation for the remaining columns in row 0.
        Once all columns in row 0 are computed, move on to compute the L values for column 0 if k<3k<3.

    L_START State (for k = 0):
        Set i = k+1 (i.e., i=1i=1).
        Reset sum and m to begin calculating L[i][0]L[i][0].

    L_M_LOOP State:
        With k=0k=0, there is no summation (the inner loop condition m < k is false immediately).
        Transition directly to L_STORE.

    L_STORE State:
        Compute L[1][0]=A[1][0]−sumU[0][0]L[1][0]=U[0][0]A[1][0]−sum​.
            Note on Arithmetic:
            In our simulation using integers, the result of 3443​ (for example) is 0 because of integer division. In a design with proper fixed-point or floating-point arithmetic, you would see a fractional value (e.g., 0.75).
        Repeat for i=2i=2 and i=3i=3 (if applicable).
        When all rows for column 0 are processed, transition to NEXT_K.

    NEXT_K State:
        Increment k to 1.
        Since k<3k<3, return to U_START for the next pivot.

Processing Subsequent Pivots (k = 1, 2, 3)

For each pivot kk:

    U_START is used to compute the U[k][j]U[k][j] elements for j=kj=k to 3.
    The inner loop U_M_LOOP accumulates the sum ∑m=0k−1L[k][m]×U[m][j]∑m=0k−1​L[k][m]×U[m][j].
    U_STORE subtracts this sum from A[k][j]A[k][j] and stores the result in U.
    Then L_START begins the computation of L[i][k]L[i][k] for rows i=k+1i=k+1 to 3.
    L_M_LOOP accumulates ∑m=0k−1L[i][m]×U[m][k]∑m=0k−1​L[i][m]×U[m][k] for each row.
    L_STORE computes L[i][k]=A[i][k]−sumU[k][k]L[i][k]=U[k][k]A[i][k]−sum​.
    Finally, NEXT_K increments kk until all pivots are processed.

Finalizing the Computation

    DONE_STATE:
    When kk has reached 3 (and the corresponding row and column have been computed), the FSM enters DONE_STATE.
    Here, the internal arrays L and U are repacked into the output buses L_out and U_out, and the done signal is asserted. This tells any testbench or higher-level module that the LU decomposition is complete.

6. Key Points to Remember

    Loop Control:
    The indices k, i, j, and m manage the nested loops of the LU algorithm. They ensure that:
        The outer loop runs over the pivot positions.
        For each pivot, the U row is computed before computing the corresponding L column.
        Inner loops (U_M_LOOP and L_M_LOOP) accumulate products necessary for subtraction.

    Arithmetic Considerations:
    In this example, all arithmetic is done using 32-bit signed integers. Therefore, operations like division truncate the fractional part. For accurate fractional (or floating–point) results, you would need to modify the design to use fixed–point arithmetic or a floating–point unit.

    FSM Design:
    The FSM breaks the computation into manageable steps so that each state completes a small part of the overall LU decomposition algorithm. This makes the design easier to understand, debug, and (if needed) synthesize into hardware.
